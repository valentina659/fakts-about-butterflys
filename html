    <h1 class="h">Interesting facts</h1>
    <p> 1.Butterflies actually have four wings, not two. Despite how they may appear in motion, or in drawings or
        paintings you may have seen, butterflies have four separate wings. The wings closest to its head are called the
        forewings, while those in the rear are called the hindwings. Thanks to the strong muscles in the butterfly’s
        thorax, all four wings move up and down in a figure-eight pattern during flight. </p>
    <p> 2.Some butterfly species migrate from the cold.
        Although in many cases cold weather will end the already short life of a butterfly by rendering them immobile,
        others take the dropping temperature as a signal to move. Butterflies are cold-blooded and require – in ideal
        settings – a body temperature of approximately 85 degrees to activate their flight muscles. If the weather
        begins changing some species simply migrate in search of sunshine. Some, like the North American Monarch, travel
        an average of 2,500 miles!</p>
    <p>3.Butterfly wings are transparent. Before you feel the need to schedule an eye exam, let us explain. The wings of
        a butterfly are covered in a multitude of miniature scales –thousands of them. And those colors you see when a
        butterfly flits across your yard are the reflection of various colors through the scales. The wings themselves
        are made up of a protein called chitin, which is the same protein that forms an insect’s exoskeleton. And much
        like an exoskeleton, chitin is transparent. You’ve learned something new already!</p>
    <p> 4.Butterflies Have Up to 17,000 Mini Eyes
        Unlike humans, butterflies have compound eyes. This means that they have one big eye that comprises up to 17,000
        mini eyes. More impressively, each of these eyes can see up to nine colors, whereas humans can only see three.
        This allows them to detect ultraviolet light, which "allows them to see the ultra-violet patterning on flowers"
        and helps them to more effectively find the pollen!</p>
    <p> 5.Painted Lady Butterflies Weigh Less than a Paperclip
        With a wingspan of under three inches and a weight of less than a gram, these dainty little insects are quite
        tiny! However, they don't even crack the top ten smallest butterfly list!</p>
    <p>6.Pictures of butterflies can be seen on ancient Egyptian frescoes in Thebes. These frescoes are estimated to be
        over 3,000 years old.</p>
    <p>7.The Mourning Cloak butterfly will play dead around predators.</p>
    <p>8.Butterflies hide in underbrush, leaves, and other places of shelter when it rains. Their wings can become torn
        from the wind and the heavy rainfall.</p>
    <p>9.In the pupa stage, the caterpillar's body is turned to a gel-like liquid and many cells are broken down and
        reorganized, while some organs stay the same.</p>
    <p>10.Once a caterpillar hatches from the egg, it can increase its size 30,000 times before it is ready for the pupa
        stage.</p>
